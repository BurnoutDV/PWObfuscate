# PWObfuscate
Small Java GUI Program that hides the a given alphanumerical Password within other passwords so it can be written/printed out on physical paper 

Use Case:
You get some passwords from x and cant change them, the passwords are complicated but the use of a password manager is for reasons unknown not adviseable. 

You decide to store those passwords by hiding them in plain sign. But your personal password book might not be save enough.

Therefore you use colored pens to write down tons of gibberish on a page that somewhere contains the passwords. To make sure that the password is hidden by proper randomness and not human bias you use a program, and cause you have to do this kinda often you write a java application for that

you also wanted to always try javafx, so you do that.
